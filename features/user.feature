Feature: User profile
    In order to allow users to log in and maintain their account
    information, I need user profiles.
    Scenario: Sign up
        A new user should be able to sign up for an account
        Given I am a new user
        When I visit the main page
        Then I should see a 'Sign up' link
        When I click the 'Sign up' link
        Then I should see a signup form
        When I fill in the signup form
        Then I should be logged in
        And I should see my profile


    Scenario: Log in
        A user should be able to log in to his/her account
        Given I am an existing user
        When I visit the main page
        Then I should see a 'Log in' form
        When I fill in the login form
        Then I should be logged in
        And I should see my profile
